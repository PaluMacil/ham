# Ham (SMS spam classifier)

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple probabilistic SMS spam
classifier in Go. This supervised learning activity is accomplished using a
Naive Bayes classifier. This simple algorithm assumes conditional independence,
does a lot of counts, calculates some ratios, and multiplies them together.
